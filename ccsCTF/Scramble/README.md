# Scramble

We have to put the picture data back together.

Using the `file` command we can see that file `838289` is the first file because of the header `89 50 4e 47`.

To fully recover the picture :

    1. Run the code.
    2. Check through all the generated images.
    3. Find the correct one.
    4. Rename it to 838289.
    5. Repeat.
